Large language models have become a potential pathway toward achieving artificial general intelligence. Recent works on multi-modal large language models have demonstrated their effectiveness in handling visual modalities. In this work, we extend the research of MLLMs to point clouds and present the LAMM-Dataset and LAMM-Benchmark for 2D image and 3D point cloud understanding. We also establish an extensible framework to facilitate the extension of MLLMs to additional modalities. Our main contribution is three-fold: 1) We present the LAMM-Dataset and LAMM-Benchmark, which cover almost all high-level vision tasks for 2D and 3D vision. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our dataset and benchmark. 2) We demonstrate the detailed methods of constructing instruction-tuning datasets and benchmarks for MLLMs, which will enable future research on MLLMs to scale up and extend to other domains, tasks, and modalities faster. 3) We provide a primary but potential MLLM training framework optimized for modalitiesâ€™ extension. We also provide baseline models, comprehensive experimental observations, and analysis to accelerate future research. Codes and datasets are now available at [https://github.com/OpenGVLab/LAMM](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/LAMM). Project page is [https://openlamm.github.io](https://openlamm.github.io).
